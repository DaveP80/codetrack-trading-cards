# Team Generator Project (Tier 1)
People Operations Department

## Project Brief
Build an automated team formation tool to streamline the sprint team creation process.

## Core Requirements
Your script needs to:
1. Scrape all student names and total points from https://pursuit.codetrack.dev/ site from the `Chrome Browser`
2. Store these names in a CSV for record-keeping
3. Randomize the student order from the CSV file in order to send to the Gemini API for fair distribution
4. Use AI to generate creative team names and group students into teams of 5
5. Output the results in a formatted text file with team names, emojis, and members

## Technical Specifications

### Suggested Libraries
You may add any libraries you'd like to your project.

```python
# Core libraries
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv  # For API key management
from selenium import webdriver  # For web automation
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # For HTML parsing
import csv                     # For data storage
import random                  # For randomization
import time                    # For rate limiting
```

### Suggested Function Structure
- `setup_api()`: Configure API credentials and return client
- `scrape_student_data(url, num_students)`: Web scraping logic
- `save_to_csv(data, filename)`: Data export functionality
- `load_and_randomize_data(filename)`: Data processing
- `generate_teams(students, team_size)`: Team creation logic
- `save_team_assignments(teams, filename)`: Output generation

### Recommended Output Format for Text File
```
ðŸš€ [Team Name]
â€¢ [Student Name]
â€¢ [Student Name]
â€¢ [Student Name]
â€¢ [Student Name]
â€¢ [Student Name]

[Next team...]
```

## Deliverables
1. Python script that runs end-to-end with error handling using try..except blocks
2. Generated CSV file with student names
3. Final text file with team assignments
