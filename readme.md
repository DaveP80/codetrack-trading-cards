## Context
Hey developers! We've got two exciting projects from different departments that need your Python expertise. Both projects involve working with our Codetrack platform data, but they serve different business needs.

## Project Tiers
We've categorized these projects based on complexity:
- **Tier 1 (Entry Level)**: Team Generator - Perfect for developers getting comfortable with basic web scraping and API integration
- **Tier 2 (Advanced)**: Trading Card Generator - Ideal for developers ready to tackle more complex data processing and frontend HTMLgeneration

## Department Needs

### People Operations - Team Generator (Tier 1)
The People Ops team is struggling with manual team formation for sprints. They need an automated solution to create balanced teams while keeping the process fun and engaging. This project focuses on basic data collection and AI-powered team formation.

### Marketing Department - Trading Card Generator (Tier 2)
The Marketing team wants to create engaging "Developer Trading Cards" to showcase our fellows' achievements in a fun, gamified way. This project requires more complex data processing, AI integration, and frontend generation skills. The cards will be used for social media, community engagement, and potentially physical prints.
